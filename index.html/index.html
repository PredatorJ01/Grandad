			<h3>Why?</h3>
			<p class="block-Text">He has the most hysterical jokes and is incredibly charming. He used his unbeleivable crafting skills to make a magnificent pizza oven that will blow the socks off anyone who sees it. You'll never meet a man more resourceful than he is or one so good at managing money. An example of his resoucefulnnes is hoe he can provide himself an entire luch for free by collecting up tasters from cosco. His intelligence is so great that many can't even understand the things he comes up with. My nan, His partner in awsomeness keeps his immense power in check and ensures that he doesn't cause any unwanted troublw. together they are an unstopable force of coolness.   </p>
